

Welcome to the "Visitor Buy Prediction and New Product Recommendation" Hackathon! 
Please look at the below details to understand about the problem statement and expected solution

*******Data******* 

This hackathon uses a Kaggle dataset. You can get the datasets as below
1. Use Kaggle API "kaggle datasets download -d retailrocket/ecommerce-dataset"
2. Go to Kaggle account --> Datasets --> Search for Retailrocket recommender system dataset
3. Available on TEAMS hackthon channel

Please look at the Kaggle Dataset details to understand the data and problem better


**********Problem statement**********
Problem statement details are available in the TEAMs channel "Problem statement.pdf"


********Rajani' Algorithm with Code********
Rajani's code is available in TEAMs channel "EventSeqMatching_rajani.ipynb"
You can find the same code on Kaggle or use this API call kaggle kernels pull code/rajanirai/event-seq-pattern-similarity-transactionprediction
Also - This code was written by me in 4 hrs (time constraint) so i would expect you to use this only for directional inputs. I will not be explaining the algorithm and workings to this code 
Before the Hackathon is over. Post all submissions - I will explain the code on request basis

********Final Result submission***********
Please use the Folder "final Submission to submit your results. 
Create a subfolder with your name and make sure below documents are available
1. Python Notebook ( I should be able to run the code without any error)
2. Presentation explaining what you have done with accuracy results for problem statement 1 and Proposed algorithm for problem statement 2
3. A word doc file which explains each and every prediction made on the test data (Please check the Problem statement pdf for more detail)

***********Evaluatio Details****************
1. Post you have submitted your solution, there will be a 15 mins connect with you where you will take me through the presentation and word doc for first 10 mins
